*** ka r g b
    Specifies the ambient reflectivity using RGB values.
*** kd r g b
    Specifies the diffuse reflectivity using RGB values.
*** ks r g b
    Statement specifies the specular reflectivity using RGB values.
*** Tf r g b
    Statement specifies the transmission filter using RGB values.
*** illum illum_#
    The "illum" statement specifies the illumination model to use in the material.
 0		Color on and Ambient off

*** d factor
    Specifies the dissolve for the current material. "factor" is the amount this material dissolves into the background. A factor of 1.0 is fully opaque. This is the default when a new material is created. A factor of 0.0 is fully dissolved (completely
transparent).
*** Ns
    Specifies the specular exponent for the current material. This defines the focus of the specular highlight.
*** Ni
    Specifies the optical density for the surface. This is also known as index of refraction.
